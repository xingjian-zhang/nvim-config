# =============================================================================
# Each line below is a complete tip. Run 'nvim_tip' to see random tips.
# For detailed explanations, see: https://neovim.io/doc/user/
# =============================================================================

# --- FILE NAVIGATION ---
Space ff → Find files by name. Type partial names like "mpy" to match "main.py"
Space fg → Search text in all files (grep). Requires: brew install ripgrep
Space fb → Switch between open buffers (files loaded in memory)
Space fr → Open recently edited files, even from previous sessions
Space e → Open file explorer. Use j/k to navigate, Enter to open, - to go up

# --- WINDOW MANAGEMENT ---
Ctrl+h/j/k/l → Move between windows (left/down/up/right). Works in terminal too!
:vsp filename → Open file in vertical split (side by side)
:sp filename → Open file in horizontal split (top/bottom)
:q → Close current window. :qa closes all windows and exits Neovim

# --- TERMINAL MANAGEMENT (toggleterm) ---
Ctrl+` → Toggle terminal on/off. Terminal keeps running when hidden
Space t1 → Toggle terminal #1. Also: Space t2, Space t3
Space tc → Open Claude Code in a dedicated terminal
Space ft → Find terminals via Telescope (preview + search all terminals)
Ctrl+\ → Exit terminal mode to normal mode (lets you scroll/copy terminal output)

# --- BASIC MOVEMENT ---
w → Jump to START of next word. Example: "hello world" → cursor jumps h to w
b → Jump BACK to start of previous word
e → Jump to END of current word
0 → Jump to start of line. $ → Jump to end of line
gg → Go to top of file. G → Go to bottom. 42G → Go to line 42
Ctrl+d → Scroll down half page. Ctrl+u → Scroll up (cursor stays centered)
% → Jump to matching bracket. Put cursor on { and press % to find matching }
f{char} → Find char forward on line. fw jumps to next 'w'. Use ; to repeat

# --- ENTERING INSERT MODE ---
i → Insert at cursor. a → Insert after cursor (append)
I → Insert at start of line. A → Insert at end of line
o → Open new line below and insert. O → Open new line above
Esc → Return to normal mode from anywhere

# --- COMMENTING (Comment.nvim) ---
gcc → Toggle comment on current line
gc + motion → Comment a motion (e.g., gcap = comment paragraph, gc3j = comment 3 lines down)
gc in visual → Comment all selected lines
gbc → Toggle block comment on current line

# --- EDITING BASICS ---
u → Undo. Ctrl+r → Redo. Neovim remembers undo history even after restart!
. → Repeat last change. Delete a word with dw, then press . to delete another
x → Delete character under cursor
dd → Delete entire line (also copies it). p → Paste below, P → Paste above
yy → Yank (copy) entire line. Works with system clipboard in your config

# --- THE VERB + MOTION PATTERN ---
dw → Delete from cursor to next word. d$ → Delete to end of line
cw → Change word (delete + enter insert). c$ → Change to end of line
yw → Yank word. y$ → Yank to end of line
Verbs: d=delete, c=change, y=yank, v=visual. Combine with any motion!

# --- TEXT OBJECTS (the powerful i and a modifiers) ---
ciw → Change Inner Word. Works from ANYWHERE in the word, not just the start!
caw → Change Around Word (includes surrounding whitespace)
ci" → Change inside quotes. "hello" becomes "" with cursor inside. Quotes stay!
ca" → Change around quotes. Deletes the quotes too
ci( → Change inside parentheses. foo(bar) becomes foo()
ci{ → Change inside braces. Also works: ci), ci}, ci], ci>, cit (HTML tags)
diw, di", di( → Same pattern but just delete, don't enter insert mode
yiw, yi" → Same pattern but yank (copy) instead

# --- VISUAL MODE (selecting text) ---
v → Visual mode (select characters). Move cursor to extend, then d/y/c
V → Visual LINE mode. Selects entire lines, much easier for code blocks
Ctrl+v → Visual BLOCK mode. Select a rectangle! Great for multi-line edits
After selecting: d=delete, y=yank, c=change, >=indent, <=unindent
J → Move selected lines DOWN (custom binding). Great for reordering code!
K → Move selected lines UP (custom binding). Pairs with J for quick reorganization
< and > → Indent/unindent and STAY in visual mode (custom). Repeat without reselecting!

# --- SEARCH ---
/text → Search forward. ?text → Search backward. Press Enter to search
n → Next match. N → Previous match. Esc clears highlighting (your config)
* → Search for word under cursor. Great for finding all uses of a variable!
:%s/old/new/g → Replace all "old" with "new" in file. Add c for confirmation

# --- LSP (smart code features in Python, etc.) ---
gd → Go to Definition. Jump to where function/class/variable is defined
gr → Go to References. Find all places where this symbol is used
K → Show hover docs. See function signature, docstring, type info
Space rn → Rename symbol everywhere. Much safer than search/replace!
Space ca → Code actions. Quick fixes like "import this module"

# --- AUTOCOMPLETE ---
Tab → Next suggestion. Shift+Tab → Previous. Enter → Accept
Ctrl+Space → Manually trigger autocomplete if it doesn't appear

# --- SAVING & QUITTING ---
Space w → Save file. Space q → Quit window
:w → Save. :q → Quit. :wq → Save and quit. :q! → Quit without saving
:qa → Quit all. :wa → Save all. ZZ → Save and quit (quick shortcut)

# --- BUFFERS ---
:ls → List all open buffers with their numbers
:b name → Switch to buffer by partial name. :b main → opens main.py
:bd → Close current buffer (unload from memory)
Space fb → Fuzzy find buffers (easier than :ls)

# --- MARKS (bookmarks) ---
ma → Set mark 'a' at cursor. Use any letter a-z
'a → Jump to line of mark 'a'. `a → Jump to exact position
:marks → List all marks

# --- MACROS (record and replay) ---
qa → Start recording macro into register 'a'. Press q again to stop
@a → Replay macro 'a'. @@ → Replay last macro. 5@a → Replay 5 times

# --- PRO TIPS ---
TIP: Press Space and wait 300ms to see all leader keybindings (which-key)
TIP: Press g and wait to see all g-prefixed commands like gd, gr, gg, etc.
TIP: Learn ONE new command at a time. Use it until natural, then learn another
TIP: ci" and ciw will change your life. They work from ANYWHERE in the text!
TIP: Use * to search for word under cursor. Instantly find all occurrences
TIP: In visual mode, press o to jump cursor to other end of selection
TIP: Ctrl+o in insert mode → do ONE normal command, then back to insert
TIP: gv → Re-select last visual selection. Useful if you pressed Esc by accident
TIP: :earlier 5m → File as it was 5 minutes ago. :later 5m → Go forward
TIP: Ctrl+a → Increment number under cursor. Ctrl+x → Decrement
TIP: If doing something repetitive, there's probably a better way. Ask yourself: is there a motion for this?
TIP: :help {topic} → Help for anything. :help ciw explains ciw. Ctrl+] follows links
